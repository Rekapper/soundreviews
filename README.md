Welcome to SoundReviews!
===================


Soundreviews is a concept idea where an artist or a band could provide embedded links to their latest works for a simple recent discography site.  This would also provide them a [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) like platform to have anonymous users (or in a future instance of customization log-in based) vote and comment on each song in a simple accessible method.

For now this is built on Node.js primarily for the purpose of being fast and simple to host for anyone even in small modular app form.   In later builds, this could be also a platform which provides a simple html template with customization layouts for the artists and bands to utilize.
